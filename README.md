# Stochastic data processing and simulation with R

Lab1-* are different methods for implementing robustness and distribution assumptions.

Lab3-* are different methods for implementing reliability and survival for systems.

Lab4-* are different methods for implementing bootstrap, both parametric and non-parametric.

Lab6-* are different methods for implementing simulation of stochastic processes.
